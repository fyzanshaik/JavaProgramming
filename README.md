# JavaProgramming
Beginning to learn programming in Java, this GitHub repository tracks and stores all Java programs I made and in learning Git.
Current OS : Windows 
Programming tutorial : Programming with Mosh Java tutorial 
Hopefully I connect git with github succesfully.
Edit : Git was connected succesfully Git Bash is ugly, miss the Ubuntu CommandLine but Ubuntu gave lot's of issues with "mt device" being the common one will stick to windows for now.
